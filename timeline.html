					<h2>🌎 Moonlander</h2>
					<p>This project simulates a lunar lander using Python, modeling the physics of gravity, thrust, and fuel
						consumption during the landing process. The lander’s altitude and velocity are tracked over time, and the
						simulation runs until the lander safely reaches the moon's surface. The results are visualized using
						matplotlib, which generates plots of altitude and velocity versus time. Users can input parameters such as
						gravity, thrust, and fuel consumption, allowing for different landing scenarios. The goal is to demonstrate
						basic physics simulations and create interactive visualizations of the landing process. <a
